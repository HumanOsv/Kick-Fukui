# Kick-Fukui Algorithm

![alt text](https://github.com/HumanOsv/Logos/blob/master/Gihub.jpg)

A novel program for the search of global minimum structures of atomic clusters and molecules in the gas phase, using as a Coulomb interaction between Fukui functions-based method, is introduced in this work. The proposed strategy involves different steps. First, the calculation of the Fukui functions of the different fragments identifying them as electron- acceptor or donor species, according to their chemical potential value. Second, a population of individuals, created by the interaction between molecular fragments, is generated by the stochastic distribution of these fragments in size selected spatial box. Thirstily, the best structures are selected according to their Coulombic interaction between Fukui functions values.  Subsequently, the best candidates are relaxed to the nearest local minimum using a gradient method, i.e., ab-initio or DFT methods.


# Getting Started

**1)	Step Zero**

Before starting the installation, it is important to know that Kick-Fukui is not a full or autonomous software; instead, it needs an assisting program to calculate energies and perform optimizations like Open Babel, Lammps, Gaussian and Mopac. SnippetKick uses these pre-installed tools for the minima local search on the potential energy surface (PES).

**1. Installing external softwares.**

  •	Open Babel (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation) (Optional)

  •	Mopac (http://openmopac.net/Download_MOPAC_Executable_Step2.html)

  •	Gaussian (http://gaussian.com/)

  •	Lammps (https://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html#ubuntu) (Optional)
  

**2. Installing Perl environment.**

Once the programs for  both energy calculations and geometry optimizations are working correctly, the Perl environment needs to be installed as well. Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language that runs on many platforms from portable to mainframes.
It can be installed from:
- https://www.perl.org/get.html

There are some additional libraries and softwares that must also be installed to allow Kick-Fukui to work:

-Install CPAN modules (http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html or https://egoleo.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/how-to-install-perl-modules-through-cpan-on-ubuntu-hardy-server/)

    user$ cpan Parallel::ForkManager
      
    user$ cpan Math::Matrix

**2)	Downloading and Installing Kick-Fukui**

Kick-Fukui can be directly downloaded as a zip file from the page:

-https://github.com/HumanOsv/Kick-Fukui

Alternatively, it can be downloaded using the Git tools using the following command:

    user$ git clone https://github.com/HumanOsv/Kick-Fukui.git

    user$ cd ./Kick-Fukui

**Note: before downloading using Git tools, make sure to be in your final installation path.**

We recommend to install using Git tools to update future Kick-Fukui software easily. To update the program, use the following command:

	user$ git pull master
	
Alternatively, Kick-Fukui could be installed as follows: choose a final installation path, and then extract the ZIP file (containing the software). Provide all the basic permissions for use and, optionally, set SnippetKick.pl file as a system call.

**3)	Running Kick-Fukui**

To run Kick-Fukui the following files are necessary in the working directory:

    • Config.in                 : The Kick-Fukui input file, see below for more information.
    
    • DupGrigoryanSpringborg.pl : The executable file for duplicate molecular fragments.

    • Kick-Fukui_Algorithm.pl   : The executable file for structure prediction.

**Note: Kick-Fukui.pl can be called from another path if correctly set**

Now, use the following commands to execute this program:

    user$  perl Kick-Fukui.pl Config.in > out.log

Alternatively, the user can set Kick-Fukui to run in the background using one of the following methods:

	user$ nohup perl Kick-Fukui.pl Config.in > out.log
	user$ setsid perl Kick-Fukui.pl Config.in > out.log

**4)	Input File**

The main input file, known as input.dat, contains all the necessary parameters for a correct calculation. Each variable is explained below.

The Initial Population size (10N,N = Atoms number)

    kick_numb_input = 1000

The size of the box (in Angstroms) length, width, and height.

    box_size = 6.00,6.00,6.00
    
Element symbols and number of atoms for each chemical species. (example: Li 05 or empty)

    chemical_formula = 

**NOTE: Respect the spaces.**

Name of molecular fragments in the simulation.

    fragments = H2O,H2O,H2O

Restricted molecular fragment (YES/NO): 

    fragm_fix = NO

**NOTE: It will always be the first molecular fragment to be placed in keyword fragments.**

Search for duplicate molecular fragments (0=No/1=Yes)

    duplicates = 0

Number of final geometries. 

    kick_numb_output = 10

**NOTE: Species to send for quantum calculations.**


*Configuring the program for chemistry packages*

The number of processors to use in the run (the value may be used to create the input file) and memory to be used in GB.

    core_mem = 4,4

The charge and multiplicity of the candidate.

    charge_multi = 0,1

*Initial geometrical relaxation methods:*

1. Open Babel Force Field.(GAFF,Ghemical,MMFF94,MMFF94s,UFF)

       init_relax = UFF

2. Semiempirical methods of MOPAC.(AUX LARGE PM7).

       init_relax = AUX LARGE PM6

3. Input file ReaxFF Force Field of Lammps.(reaxxFF.Carbon)

       init_relax = reaxxFF.Carbon

4. Execution of only Kick method (empty)

       init_relax = 

Software mopac and gaussian (mopac/gaussian)
     
    software = gaussian

Keywords for gaussian or mopac

*1. Gaussian*

    header = PBE1PBE/SDDAll scf=(maxcycle=512) opt=(cartesian,maxcycle=512)

*2. Mopac*

    header = AUX LARGE PM6

**General Note:** Respect the spaces of separation between the symbol "=".

    Correct : software = gaussian
    Wrong   : software=gaussian

**5) SnippetKick outputs**

After a successful run of the program, several output files will be generated in your working directory.

	Final_coords_gaussian.xyz : Final coordinates XYZ file format of each species ordered less energy at higher energy (gaussian).
	Final_coords_Mopac.xyz    : Final coordinates XYZ file format of each species ordered less energy at higher energy (mopac).
	BOX_kick.vmd              : Shows the box in VMD. (command: vmd -e BOX_kick.vmd)
	out.log                   : Print summary information SnippetKick.

	XYZ_OPT_Mopac.xyz         : Local optimization Mopac.
	XYZ_Coords.xyz            : Structures generated by the Kick Method.
